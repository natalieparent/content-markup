  <h1> Editing Soft Copy </h1>

<p> Editing an electronic file and allowing the author to see the changes is called
  <i>redlining</i> (also referred to as "editing online"). Basic housekeeping includes
  removing all double spaces and converting hatches (a.k.a. "dumb quotes") to quotation
  marks and apotrophes (a.k.a. "smart quotes"). The editor need not point out these
  changes to the author.</p>
  <p> Changes to the structure and wording of the text must be communicated to the
author. A visual convention is needed for showing <s>deleted</s> and <ins>added
  or substituted</ins> can be <span class="underline">underlined
</span>, <mark class="highlight">highlighted</mark> or <ins> rendered
  in color</ins>. A line in the margin indicates that a change has been recommended.
  <ins>[Queries to the author are set of with brackets]<sup>A</sup></ins> </p>
<p> <span class="underline">underlining</span> or <s>striking out</s>; punctuation is
  visually confusing, so the editor often strikes out an entire word, <s>or phrase</s>,
  <ins>-or phrase-</ins>and types in the freshly puntuated passage as
  an addition. To hyphenate a word such as <s>secondrate</s> <ins>second-rate</ins>,
  strike it out and add the hyphenated form. Whenconverting hyphens to en dashes (1914-18)-or
  changing double hyphens to em dashes-the editor simply keys them in. Typographic styles such as
  <span class="italic">italic</span>, <b>boldface</b>, and <span class="small-caps">small capitals</span>
  also can be changed directly. </p>
<p> Although redlining is wonderfully fluid and direct, it can be dangerous. "The
  editor must scrupulously remove all traces of the editing process before releasing the
  file for design and typesetting. Potential disasters include words that are
  stucktogether, a missing, or a forgotten comment to the author <ins>[Are you out of your
  mother-loving mind?].</ins> </p>
  <p><small>A. Queries to the author can also take the form of footnotes. Identify these
    notes with letters, so they are not confused with footnotes that belong to the
    text.</small></p>
